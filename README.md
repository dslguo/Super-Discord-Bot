# Super Discord Bot

A side project where I get to explore the basics of Java, Spring and Maven by creating a discord bot with a wide range of
functionalities.


### ~ A bit of context ~
Throughout Victoria's 200+ day lockdown, my friends and I have spent most of our time studying, socializing and playing
games on discord's voice channels. To lift everyone's spirit, I thought it was a good idea to collaborate and create a
discord bot which offered a wide range of fun and interactive features. 

### Technologies I used:
- Java
- Spring
- Maven
- Javacord
- Zenquotes.io
- AWS EC2

### Commands:

!ping returns "pong" :D

!rate {your input} returns how much you resemble your input

!race to start a race and test your reaction speed against friends. The first user to react to the message wins!

!quote returns a randomly generated inspirational quote to brighten your day :)
